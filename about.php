					<h5>A-1: History</h5>
					<p class="text-justify">
						&emsp;&emsp;Once upon a time, two children went to the edge of the river to look for the spring that feeds it.
						As they dug deeper they went through the top soil and a lot of clay. Finally, they reached a layer
						of sand and one of them knew that a sturdy layer might have an underground spring and sure enough in
						a little while they found it.
						<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;A stranger was watching the children from the nearby bridge and asked what they have found.
						They wanted to keep their discovery a secret so they shouted <strong>"BUER","BUER"</strong> which is
						the Pangasinan word for <i>"sand"</i>. The man tried to repeat but he pronounced the letter "r" as the
						letter "d".
						<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;The children kept laughing at the pronunciation of the man. Running and laughing, they went to their
						family and friends about the discovery. Since then, when asked what the name of this place was, the
						people would answer "BUED".<br><br>
